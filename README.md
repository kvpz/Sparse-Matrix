Sparse Matrix multiplier
(part of project 9 of COP4530)

This program was made to multiply sparse matrices with a sparse vector or
another sparse matrix.

It was completed on 7/25/2016, the same time of the writing of this README.
It can use some improvements for better readability and performance
especially in the function in sparse.h which multiplies two sparse matrices.
